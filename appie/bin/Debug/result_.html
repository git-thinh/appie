My name is Amanda, and this is our 210th episode.</p><p>Today I'm going to talk about words that end in the letters <em>-ue</em>. I'm talking about words like <em>unique</em>, <em>avenue</em>, and <em>rescue</em>. You might not have noticed it, but each of those words had a different pronunciation for the <em>-ue</em>. In the word <em>unique</em>, the <em>-ue</em> was silent. In the word <em>avenue</em>, the <em>-ue</em> was pronounced as the <a href="/pronounce-oo-sound"><em>oo sound</em></a> (<em>oo sound</em>), like in the word <em>soon</em>. In the word <em>rescue</em>, the <em>-ue</em> was pronounced as the <a href="/long-u-practice"><em>long u</em></a> sound (<em>long u</em>), like in the word <em>cute</em>.</p>(Visit the <a href="/introduction-to-long-vowels">Introduction to Long Vowels</a> and <a href="/introduction-to-other-vowels">Introduction to Other Vowels</a> lessons for more information.)</p><p>Those words again were <em>unique</em>, <em>avenue</em>, and <em>rescue</em>. So we have three words, and three different pronunciations. Is there a pattern? Well, sort of.</p><p>Let's begin with the pattern for when the <em>-ue</em> is silent. In addition to the word <em>unique</em>, it is also silent in the following words. See if you can notice the pattern:</p><blockquote><p>antique<br>technique<br>boutique<br>grotesque<br>fatigue<br>colleague<br>vogue<br>league</p></blockquote><p>What do all those words have in common? If you noticed that all of them are spelled either <em>-que</em> or <em>-gue</em>, you are correct! This pattern works quite well, too. There is only one very common word that is spelled <em>-gue</em> that includes a vowel sound at the end of the word. That word is <em>argue</em>. What is the final sound in the word <em>argue</em>? It's the <em>long u</em> sound (<em>long u</em>).</p><p>Let's use this exception word, <em>argue</em> to transition into other words with the <em>-ue</em> ending pronounced as a <em>long u</em> sound. In case you don't remember, the <em>long u</em> sounds like a <em>y sound</em> plus the <em>oo sound</em>. Put those together, and we get (<em>long u</em>).</p><p>Besides <em>argue</em>, other words that are spelled with <em>-ue</em> at the end and sound like (<em>long u</em>) are the following:</p><blockquote><p>barbecue<br>continue<br>rescue<br>value<br>venue</p></blockquote><p>So that's two of the three <em>-ue</em> ending pronunciation patterns. One was silent, the next was the <em>long u</em>. Do you remember the third pattern? The third pattern is the <em>oo sound</em>. The <em>oo sound</em> is very similar to the <em>long u</em> sound, but does not include that initial <em>y sound</em>. The <em>oo sound</em> is pronounced as (<em>oo sound</em>).</p><p>The words that end in <em>-ue</em> that are pronounced with the <em>oo sound</em> in American English include the following. Listen closely:</p><blockquote><p>avenue<br>pursue<br>revenue<br>issue<br>statue<br>tissue<br>virtue</p></blockquote><p>I wish I could say there is a good pattern for knowing which word are pronounced with the <em>long u</em> sound and which are pronounced with the <em>oo sound</em>, but unfortunately, there just isn't one. For that reason you might be best to memorize which words are pronounced which way.</p><p>To help you hear the difference between the (<em>long u</em>) sound in <em>rescue</em> and the (<em>oo sound</em>) in <em>issue</em>, let's try a little listening quiz. I'll say a word and you decide if it's pronounced with the <em>long u</em> or <em>oo sound</em>. Ready?</p><p>value (<em>value</em> is pronounced <em>long u</em>: <em>value</em>)<br>venue (<em>venue</em> is also pronounced <em>long u</em>: <em>venue</em>)<br>revenue (<em>revenue</em> is pronounced with the <em>oo sound</em>: <em>revenue</em>. Listen to the difference between <em>venue</em> and <em>revenue</em>: <em>venue</em>, <em>revenue.</em>)<br>virtue (<em>virtue</em> is pronounced with the <em>oo sound</em>: <em>virtue</em>)<br>continue (<em>continue</em> is pronounced <em>long u</em>: <em>continue</em>)</p><p>How did you do? I hope that wasn't too hard. Are you ready for some listen and repeat practice? I'll say a word and leave time for you to repeat it after me. I'll start with the words that have a silent <em>-ue</em>:</p><blockquote><p>unique<br>antique<br>technique<br>grotesque<br>fatigue<br>colleague<br>vogue<br>league</p></blockquote><p>Now the words ending in the <em>long u</em> sound:</p><blockquote><p>barbecue<br>continue<br>rescue<br>value<br>venue</p></blockquote><p>And finally, the words ending in the <em>oo sound</em>:</p><blockquote><p>avenue<br>issue<br>pursue<br>revenue<br>statue<br>tissue<br>virtue</p></blockquote><p>That's all for today, everyone. This has been a Seattle Learning Academy digital publication. Seattle Learning Academy is where the world comes to learn.</p><p>Thanks for listening. Bye-bye.</p></div></div>
